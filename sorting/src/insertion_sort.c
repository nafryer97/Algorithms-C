/*
 * At each array position, check the current value against the largest known
 * value, which is the previous value in the array.
 *     If the current value is larger continue
 *     If the largest value is smaller, find the correct position and shift all
 *     of the larger values up. Finally, insert the current value in its correct
 *     position.
 *
 * Best Case Time Complexity:
 *     The array is already sorted -> O(n)
 *
 * Worst Case Time Complexity:
 *     The array is in reverse-order -> O(n^2)
 *
 * Average Case Time Complexity:
 *     Insertion sort is one of the fastest algorithms for sorting small arrays,
 *     but its average case complexity quickly becomes quadratic as the array
 *     size increases. This is typically around n = 10.
